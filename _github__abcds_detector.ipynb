        "The ABCDs Detector solution offers a streamlined solution for understanding how video ads align with key metrics within the [YouTube ABCD Framework](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/future-of-marketing/creativity/youtube-video-ad-best-practices/). Powered by Google AI, the tool leverages a data-driven analysis to automate the ABCD assessment, providing an objective and comprehensive report of adherence across a collection of defined features. By combining **Video** And **LLM** Google AI models, ABCDs Detector automates the evaluation process and delivers comprehensive reports on how well your ads align with the ABCD framework. This empowers you to optimize your YouTube ad campaigns for maximum impact."
